EraseConvo is a Chrome extension that automatically unsends every message you have in a messenger conversation. Unlike other extensions, which only hide the messages from the user's inbox , EraseConvo will remove messages from the RECEIVER'S inbox as well. 

Open a messenger thread , hit 'Remove' and grab a coffee. While you're gone , the extension will click on every 'unsend message' button , leaving behind no trail at all.
### This is how it works

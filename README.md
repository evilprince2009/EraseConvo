EraseConvo is a Chrome extension that automatically unsends every message you have in a messenger chain. Unlike other extensions, which only hide the messages from the user's inbox, EraseConvo will remove messages from the RECEIVER'S inbox as well. 

Open a messenger thread, hit 'Remove', and go get a coffee. While you're gone, the extension will click on every 'unsend message' button, leaving behind a trail of nothing.
### This is how it works
